System.InvalidOperationException: 
The instance of entity type '' cannot be tracked because another instance with the same key value for {'Id'} is already being tracked. 
When attaching existing entities, ensure that only one entity instance with a given key value is attached. 

Why?
	Attempting to update the data in the table along with checking the existence with the same primary key.
	Also I am trying to throw custom exception with the built-in constructor.
	
How?
	First try to do the error-free operation without the exception handling.
	Then try to do throw exception for improper operations.
