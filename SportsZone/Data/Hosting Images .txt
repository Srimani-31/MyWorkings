The error you're encountering, "Not allowed to load local resource," occurs because modern web browsers do not allow loading local files using the `file://` protocol due to security restrictions. To display images from your local file system in a web application, you should consider serving those images from a web server or using a public URL.

Here's how you can resolve this issue and display images using a public URL or a web server:

1. **Upload Images to a Web Server**:

   The best practice is to upload your images to a web server or a cloud storage service (e.g., Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage) and obtain a public URL for each image. Once you have the URLs, you can use them in your application.

2. **Serve Images from a Local Web Server**:

   If you prefer to serve images from your local machine for development purposes, you can set up a local web server. One popular option is to use a Node.js server or Python's SimpleHTTPServer module. Here's how you can do it with Node.js:

   a. Install `http-server` globally using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install -g http-server
   ```

   b. Navigate to the directory containing your images and start the server:

   ```bash
   cd D:/path-to-your-images
   http-server -p 8080 # or any other port you prefer
   ```

   c. Your images will be available at `http://localhost:8080/your-image.jpg`. Use this URL in your React application.

3. **Update the `src` Attribute**:

   Once you have a public URL for your images, you can update the `src` attribute of your `Card.Img` component to load the images:

   ```jsx
   <Card.Img variant="top" src={product.ProductImageURL} alt={product.ProductName} />
   ```

   Ensure that `product.ProductImageURL` contains the correct public URL of the image you want to display.

By following one of these approaches, you can display images in your React application without encountering the "Not allowed to load local resource" error.
